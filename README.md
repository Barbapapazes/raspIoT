## Specifications:

### Creations:

* Creation of the web interface
* Server creation
* Creation of lamps

# Use:

The user can change the status of a lamp via his web browser
The user can change the state of a lamp via a conventional switch
The system must be efficient, and not turn on the lamp in 10 seconds, but as soon as possible from the user signal
The system must be stable and therefore spit as little as possible
Will be written a specification for the python, arduino and the web server which will detail the creation and operation of each, explaining in particular the code
